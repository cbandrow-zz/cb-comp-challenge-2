# Static Comp Challenge 1
---

This project was created in order to match a design comp. Most comps are to be exactly as the designer envisioned. However, for this comp, we were given free reign to use whatever color scheme (so long as it looked good), copy, images, and icons that we felt would best contribute to the comp.
